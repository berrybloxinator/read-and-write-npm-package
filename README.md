# Getting Started

Start by importing the constructor function

```
const ReadAndWrite = require("read-and-write").ReadAndWrite;
```

Next create a new instance of the constructor function with the path to the file that you want to read from and write to

```
const fileReader = new ReadAndWrite("./users.txt");
```

# Reading From A File

The following line reads all records from the file

```
let users = fileReader.readAllRecords();
```

It should return an array of objects, each object representing one record

Example:
```
[
  {
    username: 'berrybloxinator',
    firstName: 'Brady',
    lastName: 'Liechty',
    email: 'berrybloxinator@gmail.com',
    age: '20',
    userId: '03a13ff9-9bfe-483f-8cc5-fa16caf1898b',
    timeCreated: '1/28/2020, 2:33:33 PM'
  },
  {
    username: 'skateboardnerd',
    firstName: 'John',
    lastName: 'Hill',
    email: 'skateboard4life@gmail.com',
    age: '25',
    userId: '3ef6972e-6c71-4fd2-82df-da4c2dc9baf5',
    timeCreated: '1/28/2020, 2:34:18 PM'
  }
]

```

# Appending Records

To append records pass in an array of objects

```
const users = [];
const d = new Date();
const tempUsers = [
    {
        username: "Destiny",
        firstName: "Steven",
        lastName: "Bonnell",
        email: "destiny@gmail.com",
        age: 32,
        userId: uuid.v4(),
        timeCreated: d.toLocaleString()
    },
    {
        username: "xXhardcore_gamerXx",
        firstName: "Doug",
        lastName: "Smith",
        email: "league4life@gmail.com",
        age: 29,
        userId: uuid.v4(),
        timeCreated: d.toLocaleString()
    }
];
fileReader.appendRecords(users);
```

Append records does not return anything so in this case I have to manually add the appended users to my array

```
users.push(...tempUsers);
```

Appending records will not overwrite the file, only add to the end of it.

# Writing Records

Writing records is done almost the exact same way except for the fact that the file is overwritten

```
const users = [];
const d = new Date();
const tempUsers = [
    {
        username: "Destiny",
        firstName: "Steven",
        lastName: "Bonnell",
        email: "destiny@gmail.com",
        age: 32,
        userId: uuid.v4(),
        timeCreated: d.toLocaleString()
    },
    {
        username: "xXhardcore_gamerXx",
        firstName: "Doug",
        lastName: "Smith",
        email: "league4life@gmail.com",
        age: 29,
        userId: uuid.v4(),
        timeCreated: d.toLocaleString()
    }
];
fileReader.writeRecords(users);
users = tempUsers;
```

# Deleting Records

To delete a record you have to pass in an id

An id is an object that is used to identify the record that you want to be deleted

```
const users = [];
users = fileReader.deleteRecord({
    key: "name",
    value: "Brady"
});
```

Pretty self explanatory

This will find the record with the key and value that you pass in

It will remove it from the file and return an array with all of of the records except the one that was deleted

# Editing Records

This is the most complicated function in this package

Just like the delete records function, the first parameter is an id to determine which record to edit

The second parameter is an array of id's to tell the function which parts of the record you want to change

The second parameter is where you specify the key and then specify what value you want the keys value to change to

```
users = fileReader.editRecord({
    key: "userId",
    value: 3ef6972e-6c71-4fd2-82df-da4c2dc9baf5
}, [
    {
        key: "username",
        value: "AnthonyPadilla"
    }, {
        key: "email",
        value: "anthony.padilla@gmail.com"
    }
]);
```

After running this the record with the userId of 3ef6972e-6c71-4fd2-82df-da4c2dc9baf5 would change from

```
{
    username: "A_Padilla",
    firstName: "Anthony",
    lastName: "Padilla",
    email: "a_padilla@gmail.com",
    age: 29,
    userId: 3ef6972e-6c71-4fd2-82df-da4c2dc9baf5,
    timeCreated: 1/28/2020, 2:34:18 PM
}
```

to

```
{
    username: "AnthonyPadilla",
    firstName: "Anthony",
    lastName: "Padilla",
    email: "anthony.padilla@gmail.com",
    age: 29,
    userId: 3ef6972e-6c71-4fd2-82df-da4c2dc9baf5,
    timeCreated: 1/28/2020, 2:34:18 PM
}
```

The edit record function will return an array with all of the records including the edited record

## Notes

Reading from and writing to files is always done synchronously in this package

I might see if I can do a version to choose between synchronous and asynchronous
